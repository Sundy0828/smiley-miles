          She ran for Dad:
        </Typography>
        <Typography gutterBottom variant="body1" component="div">
          Last night I couldn't sleep. I knew I was tired but my mind wouldn't
          settle. I was facing yet another of many sleepless episodes since
          Dad's passing over two years ago. As I'd done so many times before, I
          got out of bed and reached for the collection of cards Dad had sent me
          over the years (birthday, Christmas, Valentine's, and Easter cards.)
          The occasions were varied but the message of love was always the same.

          Following my restless night I woke to a rainy day. Signs in our
          neighborhood announced the Adams Area Fire District 1st Annual 5K
          Run/Walk. Although I wanted to support the fire department, the sound
          of rain on my roof convinced me otherwise. I don't need to run to
          support the cause, I reasoned. If I want to help them out I can just
          send a donation.

        <Typography gutterBottom variant="body1" component="div">
          Walking into my dressing room I noticed Dad's exercise watch on my
          dresser. It had stopped working around the time of his death. Although
          its usefulness was gone, I just didn't have the heart to throw it
          away. It remained on my dresser as a silent reminder of the importance
          Dad placed on maintaining health and fitness. As I glanced at it this
          morning, I noticed something different. The watch was flashing on and
          off! This couldn't be happening! I had checked that watch countless
          times in the past, but each time I pushed the buttons, nothing had
          happened. As I watched it flash on-off, on-off, the decision was made.
          For Dad's sake, I had to run that race!

          The race organizers had well planned every detail. The route was
          clearly marked and fairly level. Emergency vehicles blocked traffic
          from our road to assure our safety. Along our way some folks held out
          cups of cold water while others with stopwatches called out our speed,
          and still others offered cheers of encouragement.

        <Typography gutterBottom variant="body1" component="div">
          While striving to run our personal best, we cheered each other along
          the way. I called out words of encouragement to several slender young
          men with long strides who quickly passed me, along with one female
          runner, Debbie. I have admired Debbie for years as I've watched her
          jog through her pregnancies and, following delivery, run behind a
          joggette cradling her newborns. As I approached the half way turn
          around, I passed Debby who was already on the return route. It felt so
          good to cheer her on and I was rewarded by her winning smile.

          Of the more than ninety folks who started the race, seventy of us
          completed the route. Each of us who crossed the finish line received
          hearty applause and cheers for doing our best and supporting such a
          worthy cause. I was honored to be awarded the first place medal for
          the 50 to 59 age female category and to come in second overall among
          the women runners. Admittedly, sixteen young men and Debbie crossed
          the finish line ahead of me, but in my heart this was my day of
          triumph, because I ran for Dad.

          MEXICO CITY -- A year after Mexican presidential hopeful Roberto
          Madrazo flopped in elections and faded from view, his disqualification
          from a German marathon for cheating has thrust him back into the media
          spot-light. Madrazo, 55, who played up his marathon-runner image in
          his 2006 election campaign, was photographed beaming after he broke
          through the finish line first for his age group in the Berlin
          marathon, wearing a shiny fire engine-red tracksuit.

          Philidelphia Half Marathon:
        </Typography>
        <Typography gutterBottom variant="body1" component="div">
          This is a commentary on a story in the Jan/Feb. issue of Running Times
          (page 10 ).The story is about the Philadelphia half marathon last
          September in which the race officials took a elite woman Asmae
          Leghzaoui out of the starting line and told her that she was not
          allowed to run with the elites.Even though she has held world best in
          the 8,10, & 12k's,the reason was said to be that she did not
          preregister and that she registered that morning of the race.The race
          official confronted Asmae when she was warming up in the elite
          area,and asked her to leave,handing her the $40 entry fee in which she
          refused to take.After being escorted from the front row of the
          start,she managed to get back to the starting line in which she went
          out with the male leaders and passed 2 miles at 9:55,then stepped off
          the course shortly thereafter."She kind of solved the problem for
          us"said the race official.

          This brings up some questions and comments.One of the things that
          makes up roadracing as the best sport is that there is and should be
          no politics.In other sports if the coach don't like you as much or you
          have the unfavorable luck of not being wealthy,you do not get to
          play.When we start getting into the situations where the race
          officials can tell who and who can't run our sport,our sport loses
          that great uniqueness to it.The race official said that it was not
          "fair"to the other elite competitors because they did not know that
          she was going to run.Ask yourself this,on your next roadrace,do you
          know of all your competitors that is going to be there?Of course
          not,that is an element to this sport of roadracing.The magazine said
          that my opinion is the minority and that mostly everyone was in favor
          of elite pre-registration.For some reason this sounds like a
          politician wrote that statement..............What do you think?E-mail
          me at bonnherb@yahoo.com and give me your comments.This website is
          just not for race results but to keep an interest on where our sport
          has been and where it is going.

          THE SQUIRREL STORY:
        </Typography>
        <Typography gutterBottom variant="body1" component="div">
          20 years ago in the 80's during the Youngstown Peace Race. I was
          running about 50 yards behind a runner who had passed a squirrel that
          was sitting along the side of the road. After he passed the squirrel,
          the squirrel looked at me and jumped onto the road and the squirrel
          proceeded to run in pursuit of the runner. The runner ahead of me kept
          looking back like he was hearing the footsteps of someone behind him
          who was obviously not there. This squirrel chased the runner ahead of
          me for a good quarter of a mile and then finally ran off the road and
          onto a log. When I passed the squirrel, I noticed he was breathing
          very hard and wasn't even wearing running shoes. Also, when I told the
          runner about the squirrel later at the finish line, he thought I was a
          little bit squirrelly.
